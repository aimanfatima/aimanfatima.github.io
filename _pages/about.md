I am a Software Engineer, currently working at [Intuit Inc](https://www.intuit.com/), Bangalore, India, within the Intuit Monetization Services and Experience (MSE) team, that streamlines effective billing processes across multiple markets. 

I did my engineering from [Indira Gandhi Delhi Techninal University for Women](https://igdtuw.ac.in/), Delhi, India. I'm a tech enthusiast who is always eager to learn and explore. My area of interest lies in Software Development along with Data Science and Machine Learning.

I always look forward to honing my full-stack development skills and seeking opportunities to improvise and enhance existing solutions with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
